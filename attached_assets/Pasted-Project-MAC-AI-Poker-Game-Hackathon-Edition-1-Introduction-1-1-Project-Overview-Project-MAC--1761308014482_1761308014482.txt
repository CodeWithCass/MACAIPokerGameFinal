Project MAC — AI Poker Game (Hackathon Edition)
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
Project MAC is a web-based, single-player Texas Hold’em Poker experience built in Replit.
 You face off against AI-controlled opponents, hosted by a charismatic AI Dealer powered by an LLM (e.g. GPT or Gemini).
 The dealer provides real-time, sassy commentary and strategic hints, making every round dynamic and entertaining.
1.2 Hackathon Goals
Type
Goal
🎯 Primary
Deliver a fast, functional, and flashy poker MVP
🧠 AI Showstopper
Integrate an LLM (GPT or Gemini) as the “Dealer Cassie” for live narration + player hints
🏗️ Architectural
Keep logic modular for easy future multiplayer or leaderboard expansion


2. System Overview
2.1 Actors
Player (Human): Plays hands, makes betting decisions, requests hints.


AI Dealer (Cassie): Controls game flow, shuffles/deals, manages pot, and provides witty LLM-driven commentary.


AI Bots: Lightweight, rule-based poker opponents.


2.2 Tech Stack
Layer
Tool
Frontend/UI
v0.app or Bubble.io (rapid prototyping)
Game Logic Backend
Node.js on Replit
AI Integration
OpenAI GPT API or Google Gemini API
Visual Assets
Recraft.ai (table background, cards, avatars)
Deployment
Replit (demo) or Vercel (if time allows)


3. Functional Requirements (MVP Scope)
3.1 Game Setup & Flow
Player selects number of AI bots (1–3).


All players start with a fixed chip stack (e.g., 1500).


The dealer assigns positions (Dealer / Small Blind / Big Blind).


Deck is shuffled and hole cards dealt.


3.2 Core Gameplay
Feature
Description
Dealing
Dealer shuffles 52-card deck and deals 2 hole cards per player, plus 5 community cards (Flop, Turn, River).
Betting
4 rounds (Pre-flop → Flop → Turn → River). Simplified betting for MVP (Call, Fold, Check, Raise).
AI Decisions
Rule-based: bot folds on weak hands, calls on medium, raises on strong.
Hand Evaluation
After final round, evaluate 7-card best hands (using poker ranking logic).
Showdown
Display winner, winning hand, and chips won.

3.3 AI Dealer Features (LLM Integration)
Requirement
Description
Narration (FR-10)
Cassie comments after each phase (deal, flop, raise, showdown). Tone: sassy, charismatic, witty.
Personality (FR-11)
Dealer persona: Cassie, the cheeky casino dealer who never loses her cool.
Hint System (FR-12)
“Get Hint” button triggers an AI call with context (hole cards, community cards, bets). Cassie gives a short, fun recommendation (“Well sugar, I’d fold faster than a cheap lawn chair”).

3.4 End of Hand
Display winner, pot, and chip updates.


Offer “Play Again” or “Exit” buttons.


Player stats (games played, wins/losses) stored temporarily in browser session (no DB for MVP).



4. Non-Functional Requirements
Responsiveness: Gameplay updates in under 1s.


LLM Latency: Commentary returns <3s.


UI Clarity: Clearly show cards, chips, pot, and actions.


Extensibility: Code separated into modules:


gameLogic.js – deck, deal, winner logic


dealerAI.js – LLM prompts & responses


ui.js – handles user interaction



5. Open Questions & Assumptions
No all-in or side-pot logic in MVP.


AI Bots use rule-based heuristics (not LLM-driven).


No persistent user accounts for now.


TBD: LLM API cost limits (use local “mock” if quota exceeded).

After a Raise
“Ooh, someone’s feeling lucky. Don’t make me call your bluff!”
