## Architecture

### Core Files

#### 1. `/client/src/lib/game.ts`
**Purpose:** Core game logic and state management

**Key Components:**
- **Deck Management**
  - `createDeck()`: Creates a standard 52-card deck
  - `shuffleDeck()`: Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
  
- **Game Initialization**
  - `initializeGame(botCount, startingChips)`: Sets up a new game
  - Automatically assigns dealer, small blind, and big blind positions
  - Posts blinds (SB: $25, BB: $50)
  
- **Card Dealing** (FR-5)
  - `dealHoleCards()`: Deals 2 private cards to each player
  - `dealFlop()`: Burns 1, deals 3 community cards
  - `dealTurn()`: Burns 1, deals 1 community card
  - `dealRiver()`: Burns 1, deals 1 community card
  
- **Player Actions** (FR-7)
  - `playerFold()`: Player forfeits hand
  - `playerCall()`: Player matches current bet
  - `playerCheck()`: Player passes when no bet required
  - `playerRaise(amount)`: Player increases bet
  
- **AI Bot Logic** (FR-8)
  - `getAIAction()`: Determines AI action based on:
    - Hand strength evaluation
    - Pot odds calculation
    - Position and betting history
    - Random bluffing logic
  - `evaluateHandStrength()`: Simplified hand strength calculator
    - Evaluates pairs, high cards, suited cards, connectors
    - Returns strength value 0.0-1.0
  
- **Hand Evaluation** (FR-9)
  - `evaluateHand(cards)`: Determines best 5-card poker hand
  - Correctly identifies all hand rankings:
    - Royal Flush (9)
    - Straight Flush (8)
    - Four of a Kind (7)
    - Full House (6)
    - Flush (5)
    - Straight (4)
    - Three of a Kind (3)
    - Two Pair (2)
    - One Pair (1)
    - High Card (0)
  - `compareHands()`: Compares two hands including kickers
  
- **Showdown** (FR-9)
  - `performShowdown()`: Evaluates all active players
  - Awards pot to winner(s)
  - Handles split pots in case of ties
  
- **Game Flow**
  - `moveToNextPlayer()`: Advances to next active player
  - `isBettingRoundComplete()`: Checks if round is done
  - `advanceToNextRound()`: Moves between pre-flop → flop → turn → river → showdown
  - `startNewHand()`: Rotates blinds and starts new hand

#### 2. `/client/src/lib/gameEngine.ts`
**Purpose:** Game engine orchestration and AI turn management

**Key Features:**
- **GameEngine Class**
  - Manages game state and flow
  - Orchestrates AI turns automatically
  - Validates player actions
  - Provides action options to UI
  
- **Action Execution**
  - `executePlayerAction()`: Processes player action and triggers AI turns
  - `processAITurns()`: Sequentially executes all AI turns
  - `executeAITurn()`: Single AI turn with configurable delay (default: 1500ms)
  
- **Validation**
  - `validatePlayerAction()`: Ensures action is legal
  - `getPlayerActionOptions()`: Returns available actions and limits
  
- **State Queries**
  - `isPlayerTurn()`: Check if human player can act
  - `isGameOver()`: Check if game has ended
  - `isHandComplete()`: Check if hand is complete
  - `getGameStats()`: Get current game statistics

#### 3. `/client/src/hooks/usePokerGame.ts`
**Purpose:** React hook for game state management

**Provides:**
- State management with React hooks
- Action handlers (fold, call, check, raise)
- Game control (startNewHand, startNewGame)
- Helper functions for UI
- Automatic IndexedDB persistence
- Error handling and loading states

#### 4. `/client/src/lib/db.ts`
**Purpose:** IndexedDB persistence layer

**Functions:**
- `saveGameState()`: Persists game state to IndexedDB
- `loadGameState()`: Loads saved game state
- Automatic database creation and versioning

---

## Betting Rounds (FR-6)

### Implementation
The game manages four distinct betting rounds:

1. **Pre-Flop**
   - Starts after hole cards dealt
   - Action begins left of big blind
   - Big blind is the current bet

2. **Post-Flop**
   - Triggered after flop cards revealed
   - Bets reset to 0
   - Action starts left of dealer button

3. **Post-Turn**
   - Triggered after turn card revealed
   - Bets reset to 0
   - Action starts left of dealer button

4. **Post-River**
   - Triggered after river card revealed
   - Bets reset to 0
   - Action starts left of dealer button

### Betting Round Completion Logic
A round is complete when:
- All active players have matched the current bet, OR
- Only one player remains (others folded), OR
- All active players are all-in

---

## AI Bot Decision Making (FR-8)

### Algorithm
The AI uses a simplified strategy based on:

1. **Hand Strength Evaluation** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Pocket pairs: +0.4
   - High cards (A, K): +0.3
   - Suited cards: +0.1
   - Connected cards: +0.1-0.15

2. **Pot Odds Calculation**
   - Call amount / (pot + call amount)
   - Used for call/fold decisions with medium hands

3. **Decision Matrix**
   - **Strong hands (>0.75)**: Usually call or raise
   - **Medium hands (0.4-0.75)**: Compare pot odds
   - **Weak hands (<0.4)**: Usually fold, occasional bluff (15%)

4. **Position Awareness**
   - Considers chip stack size
   - Adjusts aggression based on bet size

---

## Hand Evaluation Algorithm (FR-9)

### Process
1. **Count Ranks and Suits**
   - Build frequency maps
   - Sort by count then rank

2. **Check for Flush**
   - Find any suit with 5+ cards

3. **Check for Straight**
   - Look for 5 consecutive ranks
   - Handle wheel (A-2-3-4-5) special case

4. **Evaluate Hand Type**
   - Check from highest (Royal Flush) to lowest (High Card)
   - Return rank and tiebreaker values

5. **Compare Hands**
   - First compare by rank (pair < two pair < flush, etc.)
   - Then compare tiebreaker values in order

---

## Game State Schema

```typescript
{
  players: Player[],              // All players in game
  communityCards: (Card|null)[],  // 5 community cards
  pot: number,                    // Current pot size
  currentPlayerId: string,        // Player whose turn it is
  dealerMessage: string,          // Commentary from dealer
  deck: Card[],                   // Remaining cards in deck
  currentRound: string,           // pre-flop, flop, turn, river, showdown
  currentBet: number,             // Current bet to match
  lastRaiseAmount: number,        // Amount of last raise
  minRaise: number,               // Minimum raise amount
  smallBlindAmount: number,       // Small blind (25)
  bigBlindAmount: number,         // Big blind (50)
  dealerButtonIndex: number       // Dealer position index
}
```

## Player Actions Validation

### Fold
- Always valid when it's player's turn

### Check
- Valid only when currentBet === playerBet
- Cannot check if there's a bet to call

### Call
- Valid when currentBet > playerBet
- Player must have enough chips to call
- Automatically handles partial calls (all-in)

### Raise
- Must have chips for call + minimum raise
- Minimum raise = big blind (50)
- Maximum raise = player's remaining chips after call
- Validates raise amount is within valid range

---

## Data Persistence

### IndexedDB Schema
- **Database Name:** `poker-game`
- **Store Name:** `gameState`
- **Key:** `current`
- **Version:** 1

### Persistence Points
- After every player action
- After every AI action
- After game initialization
- After starting new hand

### Benefits
- Game state survives page refresh
- Automatic save/load
- No server required

---

## Integration with UI

### Pages
- **`/client/src/pages/Home.tsx`**: Main game page
  - Uses `usePokerGame` hook
  - Manages game setup and gameplay
  - Displays PokerTable component
  - Handles end-of-hand modal

### Components
- **`PokerTable`**: Main game display
- **`BettingControls`**: Player action buttons
- **`PlayerSeat`**: Individual player display
- **`CommunityCards`**: Board cards display

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No All-In Side Pots** (per spec assumptions)
   - Player can bet up to stack
   - If can't call, must fold
   
2. **Simplified AI Logic**
   - Not LLM-driven (basic rule-based)
   - Suitable for MVP, can be enhanced

3. **No Hand History**
   - Could track previous hands for statistics

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced AI** (Section 3.4)
   - LLM-powered dealer commentary
   - Strategic hint system
   
2. **User Management** (Section 3.1)
   - Login/registration
   - Persistent stats
   
3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Side pot calculations
   - Tournament mode
   - Replay hand history
   - Multi-table support
   - Multiplayer (per extensibility goal)
