## Advanced Play

### Pot Odds Example
```
Pot: $200
Call: $50
Pot Odds: 50 / (200 + 50) = 20%

If you estimate >20% chance to win, call is profitable.
```

### Expected Value (EV)
```
Win 30% of time: $300 gain
Lose 70% of time: $100 loss

EV = (0.3 √ó 300) - (0.7 √ó 100) = $90 - $70 = +$20
Positive EV = good call
```
